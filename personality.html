                <p>Throughout highschool I have developed a lot of traits. All which has had an
                    <br>tremendous effect on my academic life. In fact, it is because of my academic
                    <br>life that my traits and emotions have been nurtured in a way which bests suits
                    <br>me. Determination has always been said to be my strongest trait. It is my core.
                    <br>this is my unwavering dedication which has been allocated to achieving my
                    <br>dreams and goals, pulling through any obstacles that chooses to stand in my way.
                    <br>This has really affected my academic life as it allowed me to find that inernal
                    <br>motivation at a time of need so that I can stay engaged and present as always.
                    <br>My strongest emotion is happiness. This has affected my school life as when I
                    <br>am happy I get motivated alot, my learning improves and my confidence increases.

                <p>The online tool I used to assess myself is Kiersey and it shows that I am a guardian. 
                    <br>This is a person who is characterized as dutiful, cautious, humble and focused.
                    <br>Kiersey also makes way to say that guardians take pride in being very dependable 
                    <br>and trustworthy; if there's a job to be done, they can be counted on to put their
                    <br>shoulder to the wheel. Reflecting on that, I have always been an individual who is
                    <br>quite serious about the duties and responsibilites that are to be accomplished.They
                    <br>are what shapes us into what we are or who we aspire to be. The test also points out
                    <br>that guardians are the corner stone to society as they can be counted on regardless
                    <br>to do a particular job. Reflecting on the validity of the results, I can say that it
                    <br>is spot on 100% as it basically summerized everything that makes me who I am in
                    <br> one word and that is a guardian. Any job or task that I am given to accomplish,
                    <br>I will stop at nothing to get that task done. The test also points out a few more
                    <br>key attributes about a guardian all that sums up to my individual character.

                <p>One of my favourite scenes featuring none other than my hero Cristiano Ronaldo.
                    <br>It is there to as a reminder to me to emphasize the fact that whatever you are doing
                    <br>whether football, teaching or singing, if you do not believe yu are the best or if you
                    <br>are not dedicated 100% then you will not reach the level that you want are suppose
                    <br>to reach. You will never unlock your full potential. Cristiano Ronaldo is a football
                    <br>player who was born in Sao Pedro, Portugal in 1985. He is a spoting phenomenon.
                    <br>One of the greatest  football players of all time, a walking work of art. Vintage. The
                    <br>reason I choose him as my hero is because he thrives of hardwork, dedication and 
                    <br>discipline. His mentality is unwavering and that is the kind of mentality I try to
                    <br>base myself from.
