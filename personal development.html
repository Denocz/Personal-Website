                <p>The book Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener is actually an exciting book. Reading chapers 4 through to 7 really hit a few
                    <br>words as it thought me alot of things, things that I did not know about. From chapters 4-7 the book highlighted some key points that I
                    <br>really took into cosiderations. Some of these key points include: Achieving your goals, the proper use of time, surrounding yourself
                    <br>with the best people and being a life-long learner. In achieving your goals, the book looks at both long-term and short-term goals,
                    <br>writing them down so that they can become a reality. Writing down your goals is the best way to thread the needle towards achieving 
                    <br>all the things that you want to achieve in life. The best way to do that is to start by changing your direction. Apart from that, the
                    <br>book looks at the proper use of time, and this is how you control your time and your day and how you use your time to gear it towards
                    <br>your goals. Do not waste your time and day and dont let time control you, you should be he one to control your time and day, using it 
                    <br>towards achieving something effective. Surrounding your self with the best people is the next thing the book looked at. When achieving
                    <br>your goals, the people who you surround yourself with has a major impact on you as they often influence your attitude and that is what
                    <br>helps us to achieving our goals 90% of the time. We should surround ourselves with persons who are successful or who has the mindset to
                    <br>be better. In other words we should surround ourselves with individuals who push us to be something greater. Lastly on chapter 7, the 
                    <br>book talks about being a long-life learner. Being a formal learner and a self learner. Now a formal learner is an individual who goes to
                    <br>college and university and then they get a job and after they get that job that becomes there livng and they dont try to teach themselves
                    <br>anything new. While a self leaner is an individual who despite going to college and university they still aspire to gain new knowledge or
                    <br>should I say they teach themselves. Hence the saying from the book "Formal education will make you a living. Self-education will make you
                    <br>a fortune." We as individuals must continue to gain new knowledge and we can do so by reading plenty of books as books are a treasure that
                    <br>holds the key to a man's success. Reading chapters 4-7 from Twelve Pillars, it really showed me a greater insight into life and I can apply
                    <br>what I have learnt from the book by changing the direction that I am going or should I say change the approach that I am taking. First step
                    <br>is to jot down my goals, secondly I intend to use my time wisely, thirdly I intend to assess my inner circle and lastly, I intend to continue
                    <br>to be a self learner.
                    <br>

                    The name of the degree that I am working on is the Bachelor's Degree of Science in Computing. Three skills that I have aquired so far are
                    <br>effective communication, effective time management and critical thinking skills.
